Create a program that lets the user enter the number of chocolate eggs gathered that day.
Using / and %, compute how many eggs each sister should get and how many are left over for the
duckbear.
Answer this question: What are the total egg counts where the duckbear gets more than each
sister does? You can use the program you created to help you find the answer.

formula : eggs per sister v= numbers of eggs / 4;
          eggs for the duckbear = number of eggs % 4

        int eggsForTheDuckbear = (numberOfEggs % 4);

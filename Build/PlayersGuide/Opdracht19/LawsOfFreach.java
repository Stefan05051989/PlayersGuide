- Start with the code for computing an arrayâ€™s minimum and average values (see below)
- Modify the code to use foreach loops instead of for loops

The"for-each" loop, is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array (or other data sets):
This is the syntax :

for (type variableName : arrayName) {
  // code block to be executed
}
 */

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {4, 51, -7, 13, -99, 15, -8, 45, 90};
        int currentSmallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Start higher than anything in the array.
        /*
        The Integer class wraps a value of the primitive type int in an object.
        An object of type Integer contains a single field whose type is int.
        In addition, this class provides several methods for converting an int to a String and a String to an int,
         as well as other constants and methods useful when dealing with an int.
        This is a value-based class;
        programmers should treat instances that are equal as interchangeable and should not use instances for synchronization,
         or unpredictable behavior may occur.
        For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail

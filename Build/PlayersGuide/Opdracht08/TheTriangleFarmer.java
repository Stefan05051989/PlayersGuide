Write a program that lets you input the triangleâ€™s base size and height.
Compute the area of a triangle by turning the above equation into code.
Write the result of the computation.

I've used the double variable for a more accurate method.

The formula for calculating the surface of triangle is : base * height / 2.

        it works.. don't touch it! haha

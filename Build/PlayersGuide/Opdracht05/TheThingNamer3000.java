Rebuild the program above on your computer.
Add comments near each of the four variables that describe what they store.
You must use at least one of each comment type
Find the bug in the text displayed and fix it.
Answer this question: Aside from comments, what else could you do to make this code more understandable?

        it is possible to print this, but it is better to assign a variable of int to declare the numbers like
        i did in the program. Int stores the data of numbers, a String makes an object from the numbers.

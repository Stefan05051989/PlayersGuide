Ask the user for an x value and a y value. These are coordinates of
the enemy relative to the watchtower’s location. Positive x-values are east,
positive y-values are north (as they would be on a normal graph)
Using if statements and relational operators, display a message about what direction the enemy is coming from.
For example, “The enemy is to the northwest!” or “The enemy is here!

if : input is less / more than var, output location.
operators :
> = Greater then
< = Less than
== Equal to
&& = Returns true when both statements are true.
